Inhibitors are a way to monitor or block messages coming into the command handler.
Because inhibitors are another kind of module, we need another kind of handler.
To set it up, simply import and instantiate the InhibitorHandler, just like with the command handler. 


The first parameter in super is the unique ID of the inhibitor.

The second parameter are the options.
The option reason is what will get emitted to an event, but we can worry about that later.

The exec method is ran on testing.
It should return true in order to block the message.
Promise are awaited and the resolved value will be checked.
